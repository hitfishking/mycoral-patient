## Coral Health Patient App

This is the main app to be used by patients to interact with their medical records on the blockchain.

### Project Roadmap

#### User Interface Demo - âœ“ Completed Feb 2018 
This milestone will be a functional user interface with all data mocked from within the app.

#### Functional Demo
This milestone will include a server-side component for storing metadata, rather than the blockchain. 

##### Requirements
- Documents will be encrypted and stored in IPFS
- Private keys stored on device only
- **Coral Health will not have access to decrypt documents**

#### Testnet Demo
This milestone will use an Ethereum testnet (or private net) to store metadata, and our server-side component will be decommissioned.

##### Features
- patient/physician marketplace interaction
- patient delegation of lab data to a trusted contact

#### Full release
We will migrate to the real network


## Trouble Shooting:
##### 1) "Callback URL mismatch" error occured when visit the app from Expo Client.   
This error relates to the [AuthSession](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session.html) class in expo.
